# Bricks Breaking

# For her next karate demonstration, Arunima will break some bricks.
# Arunima stacked three bricks on top of each other. Initially, their widths (from top to bottom) are W1,W2,W3.
# Arunima strength is S. Whenever she hits a stack of bricks, consider the largest kâ‰¥0 such that the sum of widths of the topmost k bricks does not exceed S; the topmost k bricks break and are removed from the stack. Before each hit, Arunima may also decide to reverse the current stack of bricks, with no cost.
# Find the minimum number of hits Arunima needs in order to break all bricks if she performs the reversals optimally. You are not required to minimize the number of reversals.

# Input
# The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
# The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers S, W1, W2 and W3.

# Output
# For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ? the minimum required number of hits.

# Sample Input 1
# 3
# 3 1 2 2
# 2 1 1 1
# 3 2 2 1

# Sample Output 1
# 2
# 2
# 2
