# You are given a binary string S of length N. You can perform the following operation on S:

# Pick any set of indices such that no two picked indices are adjacent.
# Flip the values at the picked indices (i.e. change 0 to 1 and 1 to 0).
# For example, consider the string S=1101101.
# If we pick the indices {1,3,6}, then after flipping the values at picked indices, we will get 1?10?110?1â†’0111111.
# Note that we cannot pick the set {2,3,5} since 2 and 3 are adjacent indices.

# Find the minimum number of operations required to convert all the characters of S to 0.

# Input Format

# The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
# The first line of each test case contains an integer N - the length of the binary string S.
# The second line of each test case contains a binary string S of length N.
# Output Format

# For each test case, output the minimum number of operations required to convert all the characters of S to 0.
