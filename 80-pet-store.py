# Alice and Bob went to a pet store. There are N animals in the store where the ith animal is of type Ai?.

# Alice decides to buy some of these N animals. Bob decides that he will buy all the animals left in the store after Alice has made the purchase.

# Find out whether it is possible that Alice and Bob end up with exactly same multiset of animals.

# Input Format

# The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
# Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
# The first line of each test case contains an integer N â€” the number of animals in the store.
# The next line contains N space separated integers, denoting the type of each animal.
# Output Format

# For each test case, output on a new line, YES, if it is possible that Alice and Bob end up with exactly same multiset of animals and NO otherwise.

# You may print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings YES, yes, Yes, and yES are considered identical.
