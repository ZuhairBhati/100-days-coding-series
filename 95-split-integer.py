# Kulyash is given an integer N. His task is to break N into some number of (integer) powers of 2.

# To achieve this, he can perform the following operation several times (possibly, zero):

# Choose an integer X which he already has, and break X into 2 integer parts (Y and Z) such that X=Y+Z.
# Find the minimum number of operations required by Kulyash to accomplish his task.

# Input Format

# The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
# Each test case consists of a single line of input.
# The first and only line of each test case contains an integer N â€” the original integer with Kulyash.
# Output Format

# For each test case, output on a new line the minimum number of operations required by Kulyash to break N into powers of 2.

# Sample Input

# 2

# 3

# 4

# Sample Output

# 1

# 0
