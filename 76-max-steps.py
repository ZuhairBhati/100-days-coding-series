# You are given N integers. In each step you can choose some K of the remaining numbers and delete them, if the following condition holds: Let the K numbers you've chosen be a1, a2, a3, ..., aK in sorted order. Then, for each i â‰¤ K - 1, ai+1 must be greater than or equal to ai * C.

# You are asked to calculate the maximum number of steps you can possibly make.

# Input

# The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of each testcase follows.
# The first line of each testcase contains three integers: N, K, and C
# The second line of each testcase contains the N initial numbers
# Output

# For each test case output the answer in a new line.

# Sample Input

# 2

# 6 3 2

# 4 1 2 2 3 1

# 6 3 2

# 1 2 2 1 4 4

# Sample Output

# 1

# 2
